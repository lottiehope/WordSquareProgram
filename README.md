# Word Square Program

## To run:

When the program is running, you will be prompted to choose whether you want to run the program with built-in values or whether you want to manually enter them.

### Automatically

To run automatically, all you need to enter is ```auto```. The program will exit once done.

### Manually

To run manually, enter ```man```.

You will then be prompted to enter a string of characters to make a word square with, e.g. "aaccdeeeemmnnnoo".

You do *not* need to add the quotes.

Then you will be asked to input the size of the word square, e.g. in the abocve case it would be 4.

It will then print out the valid word square and then continue to ask you for another input.

To end the program, enter ```stop``` after a word square has been created and it prompts you to enter another string.
